# RijskViz
This repository contains the code for the final project of the CMU graduate course "Visualization in HCI" done by Kate McManus, John Hwong and myself.

The project consists in visualizing a collection of paintings from a specific museum, and we focus here on the RijksMuseum in Amsterdam.
